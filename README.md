# Visual Basic For Tetris

Implements a simplified version of Tetris within an Excel worksheet using Visual Basic for Applications. The `Tetris.bas` file contains the VBA procedures needed to run the game's mechanics, while the `Tetris.xlsm` file contains the simple user interface and game board. To start a game, simply hit the "Reset" button to clear the board and generate a new piece. The orientation of the piece can be set by pressing "Rotate", while its horizontal alignment can be shifted using the left-right arrow button. The "Drop" button allows the piece to fall vertically downward until it collides with either the bottom of the board or a previously-placed piece.
